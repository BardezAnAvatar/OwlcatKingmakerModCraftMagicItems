This is the source for my mod to add crafting of magic items to Owlcat's Pathfinder: Kingmaker CRPG.

For details, see the mod page here: https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/54

## To Do
* Enchanting bonded objects.  Requires some way to select a bonded object, and an enforcement that it's equipped thereafter.
* Make Robes fall under Craft Wondrous Items rather than Arms and Armor?
* Mundane item crafting Oversize isn't very useful when you can't combine it with other options...
* Mighty Fists enchantment is stacking - looks like a bug in Owlcat's code
* Amulet of Mighty Fists actually allows all relevant weapon enhancements (such as Flaming or Agile)... not sure if the engine can even do that. 
* Add new magic items to random loot drops?  They don't seem to go very high in CR...
* Mundane crafting - craft shields with shield spikes?  Tricky, the base spiked shield assets are weapons rather than shields...
* Mundane crafting - oversize weapons.
* Craft Rod
* In-game GUI
* Metamagic effects on spells
* Enchantment: cast spell N times a day
* Add "Fabricate" custom spell to instantly do mundane crafting, and to add special materials to existing items.
* Bracers of archery (lesser/greater) - requires both Craft Wondrous Items and Craft Arms and Armor
* Fortification enchantment - doesn't appear to be in the base game?
* Craft Construct?  Sounds complicated... either a build-your-own-pet, Eidolon style, or a Golem-in-a-bottle like arrangement.
