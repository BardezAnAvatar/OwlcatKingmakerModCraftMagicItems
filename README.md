This is the source for my mod to add crafting of magic items to Owlcat's Pathfinder: Kingmaker CRPG.

For details, see the mod page here: https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/54

## To Do
* Mundane crafting - craft shields with shield spikes?  Tricky, the base spiked shield assets are weapons rather than shields...
* Enchanting bonded objects.  Requires some way to select a bonded object, and an enforcement that it's equipped thereafter.
* Add more wondrous item recipes, including adding Robes, Ioun Stones
* Cheat: slider to customise crafting costs and item sale price from 0% (current "costs nothing" cheat) to 100% (Owlcat
    item prices) to 200% (tabletop item prices) to... more?
* Add new magic items to random loot drops?  They don't seem to go very high in CR...
* Craft Rod
* In-game GUI
* Metamagic effects on spells
* Enchantment: cast spell N times a day
* Add "Fabricate" custom spell to instantly do mundane crafting, and to add special materials to existing items.
* Fortification enchantment - doesn't appear to be in the base game?
